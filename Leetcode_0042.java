Problem:-

You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.

Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

Example 1:


Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = []
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104
0 <= ops.length <= 104
ops[i].length == 2
1 <= ai <= m
1 <= bi <= n



Solution:-
*/
class Solution {
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        int min_row = m;
        int min_col = n;
        for (int i=0; i<ops.length; i++){
            if (ops[i][0]<min_row) min_row=ops[i][0];
            if (ops[i][1]<min_col) min_col=ops[i][1];
        }        
        return min_row*min_col;
        
    }
}
